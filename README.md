# analysts-recommendations-strategy

Add analysts recommendations and Yahoo tickers of stocks into `recomm-inderes-nordea-osakekorit.csv`. You can of course change this file name.
Be careful not to break the format of this CSV-file.

Run with
`python main.py`

Results will appear in `results` folder.
`results summary.xslx` will hold the combine bracketing results.

No guarantees given :)
